# IVUS-Segmentation
Segmentation of Intravascular Ultrasound images.


## Introduction
This project aims to segment the media and lumen in ultrasound images of arteries. This problem is important because, atheroscelorotic plaque build up can narrow the walls of the arteries(stenosis) and lead to myocardial infarction. The segmentation of lumen and media borders can help doctors locate such plaque build up and help reduce the effects of stenosis if identified earlier.
